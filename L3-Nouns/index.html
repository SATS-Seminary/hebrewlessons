		<div>YHWH</div>
		<div>Nash Papyrus (MS OR.233)
This papyrus dates to about 2nd century B.C. and consists of the decalogue followed by the Shema.  It was the oldest known Hebrew manuscript prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

		<div>You might think it will take some time before you can say anything meaningful in Hebrew.  After all, we are just about to begin learning nouns and you haven’t even studied verbs!  How much can one say without a verb?
Quite a lot, actually!  
Hebrew has a knack for cramming lots of meaning into short, pithy phrases.  Perhaps one of the best known examples of this is the verbless clause that forms the content of the Shema:
Hear O Israel,
יהוה אלהינו יהוה אחד

Seemingly countless volumes have been written on this four word, verbless Hebrew clause.  It has profound depth and meaning about who God is- and all without a single verb!

		<div>Hebrew nouns are, in many respects, just like English nouns:
-A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea
-A noun can be singular or plural

A Hebrew noun is UNLIKE an English noun in these respects:
-A Hebrew noun may be “dual” in number, representing a pair of something
-Hebrew nouns are inflected for gender- masculine or feminine.  There is NO neuter in Hebrew.

Take note of the following forms.  The parts indicated in red represent the ending which decides whether a form is masculine or feminine; singular, plural, or dual.

		<div>תּוֹרה

		<div>Singular</div>
		<div>Hebrew nouns have gender:
</div>
		<div>Masculine</div>
		<div>Plural</div>
		<div>Masculine singular (MS) nouns have no distinct ending. Consider the following forms:</div>
		<div>Masculine singular (MS) nouns are endingless:
</div>
		<div>Feminine</div>
		<div>מֶלֶךְ</div>
		<div>You may have noticed by now that most Hebrew roots are “triconsonantal”, that is, they consist of three consonants.</div>
		<div>Dual</div>
		<div>סֵפֶר</div>
		<div>Hebrew nouns have number:

		<div>Add
</div>
		<div>to the end of the word
</div>
		<div>ִ</div>
		<div>ים</div>
		<div>Hebrew pluralises its nouns in much the same way English does- you add an ending.  For example, in English, we pluralise a word by adding ’s’ or ‘es’ to the root:
horse >> horses
king >> kings

Hebrew has different patterns of pluralisation, depending on the gender.  Here is how we form the masculine plural (MP):
</div>
		<div>Though the dual may be new to you, the concept and its formation is very simple.

A noun in the dual represents two of something, or a pair. Its formation is simple:
</div>
		<div>ַ֫
</div>
		<div>a pair of horses
</div>
		<div>יִם</div>
		<div>יִם </div>
		<div>ַ֫</div>
		<div>All feminine singular (FS) endings:
</div>
		<div>We have already learned that masculine nouns are endingless, or that they have no distinct ending.

Feminine nouns, by contrast, do have distinct endings.  The most common feminine singular (FS) ending is:
</div>
		<div>ה
</div>
		<div>וּת /  ִ ית  /  ֶ ת  /  ַ ת  /  ָ ה
</div>
		<div>תּוֹר
</div>
		<div>ה ָ
</div>
		<div>Like masculine nouns, feminine nouns have a distinct pattern of pluralisation.

Add the feminine plural ending


to the stem.

With feminine nouns, this usually means that we will remove the feminine singular ending before adding the FP ending shown above.
</div>
		<div>וֹת</div>
		<div>וֹת
</div>
		<div>Like masculine nouns, feminine nouns have a distinct pattern of pluralisation.

Add the feminine plural (FP) ending


to the stem.

With feminine nouns, this usually means that we will remove the feminine singular ending before adding the FP ending shown above.

		<div>The feminine dual is identical in form to that of the masculine.


However, take note of how it will look on most feminine nouns:
</div>
		<div>ת
</div>
		<div>תּוֹרָ</div>
		<div>ה will almost always change to ת or drop away when an ending is added.

		<div>ים  ִ</div>
		<div>Lexical Forms
Now that we know how to recognise an ending, we should be able to identify the root or “lexical form”.  The lexical form is what you would use to find a word's meaning in a lexicon (dictionary).

The singular form of any noun is its lexical form.

What is the lexical form of the following words?
</div>
		<div>✓
</div>
		<div>Show
Instructions
</div>
		<div>For most feminine forms, we will need to add back the dropped consonant.
</div>
		<div>Identify the root
</div>
		<div>תּוֹר</div>
		<div>Identify the endings
</div>
		<div>ה ָ</div>
		<div>Most nouns referring to
the land or earth will be
feminine
</div>
		<div>Don’t be too unsettled by this- most of the time, the gender of a noun does not affect its meaning, but only the way its plural is formed.

		<div>אֶ֫רֶץ</div>

It should come as no surprise that some Hebrew words do not follow normal patterns of pluralisation.  We have this in English.  For example, how does one pluralise the English words “child”, “man” or “woman”?

Take note of the following words which change their stem to form the plural:
</div>
		<div>נָשִׁים</div>
		<div>אֲנָשִׁים</div>
		<div>אִשָּׁה</div>
