		<div>Hebrew vowels, as we will study them, only came about in the middle ages.  The two most common systems of “pointing” the Hebrew were the Babylonian supralinear (above the line) and the Tiberian system.  The Babylonian system had fallen out of use by the 10th century, whilst the Tiberian system persisted and is what we will learn.  Pictured here is a manuscript using the Babylonian supralinear pointing.

		<div>The 'fun fact’ at the beginning of the lesson noted that vowel points only came about in the middle-ages.  However, long before the pointing, as early as 10th century B.C., scribes began using certain letters to represent vowels.  
The consonants:
י ,ה  and ו
were used to indicate vowels and are the basis of the “Vowel Letters” which we study here.  It may be helpful to consider the two ways the name ‘David’ is spelled in Hebrew:
דּוד (no vowel letter)
דּויד (with a vowel letter)
The second of these two forms makes use of the י to indicate the vowel.

		<div>Defective Writing
As you studied the above vowel letters, you likely noticed that the sounds they produce are the same as certain pointed vowels.  It will be helpful to keep this observation in mind as we study the phenomenon known as “defective writing”.  Some words which typically make use of the vowel letter are sometimes written without the letter, but use the pointed equivalent instead.  When this happens, the form is called “defective” whereas the form with the vowel letter is called “full writing” or “plene”.  This spelling variation does not change the meaning of the word and there will seldom be any pronunciation difference.
Study the words below and not the difference in the “full” and “defective” forms.  Pay particular attention to the pronunciation of these words.</div>

		<div>The “Shewa” is a special kind of vowel that does not correspond to any of the five vowel classes (a, e, i, o, u).  In the previous slide you may have noticed the two vertical dots beside the standard vowels.  This is shewa.  

Shewa comes in two flavours: vocal and silent.  Vocal Shewa has a very short pronunciation.  Shewa may also be silent, with no pronunciation value at all. We will learn how to distinguish silent shewa from vocal shewa a little later.
