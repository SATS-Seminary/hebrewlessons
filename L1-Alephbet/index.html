		<div>Izbet Sartah Abecedary (c.12th century B.C)</div>
		<div>The earliest known Hebrew inscriptions are two abecedaries- the Izbet Sartah Ostracon and the Tel Zayit Inscription. These inscriptions present the alphebet with the pe before the ayin, a reversal from what we will learn. This pecularity is sometimes used to date certain Psalms, some of which use this letter order in Hebrew acrostics.</div>

		<div>There are six consonants that have two different, but related sounds when they appear with a dot, called a daghesh.  These consonants are known as the “begadkephat” letters. It may be helpful to think of the daghesh as a kind of obstruction that stops the flow of air from your mouth.  The consonants without the daghesh do not stop, but kind of ‘leak’.
</div>
		<div>ph as in phone</div>
		<div>v as in vine</div>
		<div>*Modern Hebrew does not differentiate between the stops and spirants of these letters, but rather uses the hard pronunciation in either case.</div>
		<div>th as in thin*</div>
		<div>g as in aghast*</div>
		<div>dh as in the*</div>
		<div>There are four consonants which are classified as gutturals.  These letters are called gutturals because they are pronounced at the back of the throat.  Though the letter ר (resh) will sometimes behave like a guttural, it is not classified as one.
